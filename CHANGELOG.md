## [Unreleased](https://github.com/zjedi/hugo-scroll/compare/v.1.0.0...master)

* **JS cleanup / CSS refactoring**, possibly causing some pain if you have extensive CSS customisations in screen.css #4, #61, #102. For backwards compatibility, a released tag` v1.0.0` was created just in case some projects needed to fix the legacy version. However, I won't actively support the legacy branch.
